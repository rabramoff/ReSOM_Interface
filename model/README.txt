Reaction-network-based model of Soil Organic Matter and microbes (ReSOM)

This code is adapted from the original model code for ReSOM located here: https://github.com/jinyun1tang/one_bug_model

The code has been modified by JTang and XZhu to consider any combination of multiple pools (microbes, polymers, monomers, enzymes, mineral surfaces) though this capability is not used for the model comparison by Sulman et al. Non-equilibrium sorption mechanisms have been added. Density-dependent microbial mortality following Georgiou et al. 2017 has been added.

The model with one of each pool has been tested against an analytical solution.

The original code was written by Jinyun Tang. Run scripts for the model comparison and density-dependent mortality were added by Rose Abramoff.
